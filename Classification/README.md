# Project Classification
The goal of this project is to implement from scratch the main Machine Learning techniques we have learned so far.


## Files
dumbClassifiers.py: This contains a handful of "warm up" classifiers to get you used to our classification framework.

dt.py: Will be your simple implementation of a decision tree classifier.

knn.py: This is where your nearest-neighbor classifier modifications will go.

perceptron.py: Take a guess :).

binary.py: Our generic interface for binary classifiers (actually works for regression and other types of classification, too).

datasets.py: Where a handful of test data sets are stored.

util.py: A handful of useful utility functions: these will undoubtedly be helpful to you, so take a look!

runClassifier.py: A few wrappers for doing useful things with classifiers, like training them, generating learning curves, etc.

mlGraphics.py: A few useful plotting commands

data/*: all of the datasets we'll use.
