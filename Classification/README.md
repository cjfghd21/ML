# Project Classification
The goal of this project is to implement from scratch the main Machine Learning techniques we have learned so far.

## Introduction
The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore. You can download each of these individually, or you can head to the Files page, select the p1 folder and click the Download as Zip button.

## Files
dumbClassifiers.py: This contains a handful of "warm up" classifiers to get you used to our classification framework.

dt.py: Will be your simple implementation of a decision tree classifier.

knn.py: This is where your nearest-neighbor classifier modifications will go.

perceptron.py: Take a guess :).

binary.py: Our generic interface for binary classifiers (actually works for regression and other types of classification, too).

datasets.py: Where a handful of test data sets are stored.

util.py: A handful of useful utility functions: these will undoubtedly be helpful to you, so take a look!

runClassifier.py: A few wrappers for doing useful things with classifiers, like training them, generating learning curves, etc.

mlGraphics.py: A few useful plotting commands

data/*: all of the datasets we'll use.
